# Delete a pipeline

In order to delete a pipeline, you can either use the CLI or the Python SDK:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CLI" %}
```shell
zenml pipeline delete <PIPELINE_NAME>
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Python SDK" %}
```python
from zenml.client import Client

Client().delete_pipeline(<PIPELINE_NAME>)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Deleting a pipeline does not automatically delete any of its associated runs or 
artifacts.
{% endhint %}


## Delete a pipeline run

To delete a pipeline run, you can use the following CLI command or the client:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CLI" %}
```shell
zenml pipeline runs delete <RUN_NAME_OR_ID>
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Python SDK" %}
```python
from zenml.client import Client

Client().delete_pipeline_run(<RUN_NAME_OR_ID>)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
