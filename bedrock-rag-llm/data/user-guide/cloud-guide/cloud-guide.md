# ☁️ Cloud guide

This section of the guide consists of easy to follow guides on how to connect the major public clouds to your ZenML deployment. We achieve this by configuring a [stack](../production-guide/understand-stacks.md).

A `stack` is the configuration of tools and infrastructure that your pipelines can run on. When you run a pipeline, ZenML performs a different series of actions depending on the stack.

Note, this guide focuses on the *registering* a stack, meaning that the resources required to run pipelines have already been *provisioned*. In order to provision the underlying infrastructure, you can either do so manually, via a IaC tool like Terraform, or use ZenML's sister project [MLStacks](https://mlstacks.zenml.io/).
